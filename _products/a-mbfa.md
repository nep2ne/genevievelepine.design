name: "Multiple Birth Families Association"
description: |
  A rebranding project for a cool not-for-profit organization, including a new logo, print package, and motion promo piece.
description_1: |
  The Multiple Birth Families Association is a not-for-profit, volunteer-based organization that provides support and services to families expecting or caring for multiples (twins, triplets, etc.).
description_2: |
  For this project, the biggest challenge was to strike a careful balance between the friendly tone of the existing brand while also making it more professional to appeal to potential funders.
description_3: |
  The process initially involved lots of ideation to design a new logo, including sketching, peer input, and eventually narrowing down the possible options to arrive at one final concept.
description_4: |
  I developed a brand usage guide, and created a comprehensive suite of products to apply the new brand, including merchandising for the organization's members and volunteers, corporate print products, signage, and AR-enabled event posters. I created a short motion promo to reveal the new logo and direct traffic to the organization's website.
