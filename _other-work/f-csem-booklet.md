name: "Canadian Society for Endocrinology and Metabolism Abstract Booklet"
description: |
  This freelance project involved creating a booklet of medical research abstracts to be distributed at a professional conference. I applied my knowledge of typography to create a product that is legible, attractive and both professional and friendly. The biggest challenge was that I received the contents just a week before the booklet had to be sent off to print in order for it to be ready to ship to the conference on time.
