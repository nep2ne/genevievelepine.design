name: "Isometric Illustration"
description: |
  A school project demonstrating my ability to design isometric illustrations. The theme for this project is to show the passage of time. The illustration shows the evolution of transportation over three scenes, with the sands of time running throughout. I used subtle shifts in colour to further emphasize the passage of time from past to present and future.
