name: "Vector Brush Painting"
description: |
  I created this digital painting using real brush strokes I scanned and imported into Illustrator to create vector brushes. Because I wanted to create a nearly photo-realistic illustration, the entire process took about 60 hours of painstaking detail work, creating each daub of "paint" one by one.
