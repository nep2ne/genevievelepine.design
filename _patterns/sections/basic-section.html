          <p> I spent 15 years in a successful policy career, but something was missing. Writing policy reports was dry and pretty uninspiring. My job felt like a sweater that didn’t fit quite right.</p>
          <p>Outside of the office, I was letting my creative self out to play by painting vibrant abstracts and travelling the world. But inside the office, the sweater was feeling greyer and less comfortable by the day. Then, I accidentally met a designer in the wild—as part of one of my work files, I hired a design agency to help me create some visuals, and I discovered that collaborating with them was a whole lot more fun than my day-to-day job.</p>
          <p>Eventually, I found the courage to leave my policy job and jump into graphic design with both feet. Suddenly, I was making art, but with a purpose. I discovered the power of visuals to communicate big ideas in a clear, simple, clever, and yes, attractive way. That is why I am a designer, and the sweater finally fits.</p>
