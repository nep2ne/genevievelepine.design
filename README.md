## Graphic Designer & Reformed Policy Wonk
#### [genevievelepine.design](https://genevievelepine.design)

I spent 15 years in a successful policy career, but something was missing. Writing policy reports was dry and pretty uninspiring. My job felt like a sweater that didn’t fit quite right.

Outside of the office, I was letting my creative self out to play by painting vibrant abstracts and traveling the world.

Then, I accidentally met a designer in the wild—as part of one of my work files, I hired a design agency to help me create some visuals, and I discovered that collaborating with them was a whole lot more fun than my day-to-day job. Eventually, I found the courage to leave my policy job and jump into graphic design with both feet. Suddenly, I was making art, but with a purpose. I discovered the power of visuals to communicate big ideas in a clear, simple, clever, and yes, attractive way. That is why I am a designer, and the sweater finally fits.
